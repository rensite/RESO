# Å”ESO - What is my viewport?

Imagine that **you've created website, the client reports layout issue**.
In order to solve it we **need some more info** to investigate to source of the problem:
client's **os platform, browser vendor and the screen viewport**, etc.
It's extremely **hard to explain** non techie client **how to find out all of these specs** so we usually end up by opening screen share app:
_"alright click screen resolution is.. OS and browser. Thanks, I'll double check it."_

Being tired of wasting time I had created **the webpage that exposes all of these browser's specs** by just visiting it.
